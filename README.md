# RazekiiBot
Twitch bot developed by Razeki (aka Nathan Glick)

This is a simple Twitch bot that is still in development - the project was started as a replacement for RevloBot, which is being shut down soon. It also has normal bot functionality outside of loyalty tracking, which is listed below.

List of Features Currently:
->Loyalty point tracking / basic Revlo-style functionality
->Moderation commands !ban (user), !timeout (user), ! purge (user)
->Chat commands
->GUI for hosting locally (which allows easy changes to config information, and easily runs and stops the bot)
